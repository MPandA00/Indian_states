Uttarakhand (English: /ˈʊtərɑːˌkʌnd/,[22] /ˌʊtərəˈkʌnd/[23] or /ˌʊtəˈrækənd/;[24] Hindi: ['ʊt̪ːərɑːkʰəɳɖ], lit. 'Northern Land'), also known as Uttaranchal (English: /ˈʊtəˈræntʃʌl/; the official name until 2007),[25] is a state in the northern India. It is often referred to as the "Devbhumi" (lit. 'Land of the Gods')[26] due to its religious significance and numerous Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres found throughout the state. Uttarakhand is known for the natural environment of the Himalayas, the Bhabar and the Terai regions. It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north; the Sudurpashchim Province of Nepal to the east; the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh to the south and Himachal Pradesh to the west and north-west. The state is divided into two divisions, Garhwal and Kumaon, with a total of 13 districts. The winter capital of Uttarakhand is Dehradun, the largest city of the state, which is a rail head. Bhararisain, a town in Chamoli district, is the summer capital of Uttarakhand.[27][28][29] The High Court of the state is located in Nainital, but is to be moved to Haldwani in future.[30]
